<p> Materialism is the end goal of everything, nothing is purely creative. One
might look at it saying that materialism is the goal and creative satisfaction
is only a byproduct, the college is only the means. </p>

<p> Books are too old, big and boring to study. They arent really needed for
tests that are to be aced just once. The books dont match pace with out fast
paced world, there is too much information in the air already. Nobody needs an
explanation, just give us the short notes.</p>

<p>The Library seems eeiry to me.
Especially seeing how the engineering textbooks remain untouched.<br>
Some books have been here since the 60's some since the 70's. Finding a book
about model trains that was last issued by someone in 1978 brought up a lot of
emotions in me. Creativity, free expression lies in dusty corners, neglected
since ages. Once practiced by someone.</p>

<p>Cameras everywhere, every moment is to be captured. Maybe to make others
feel envious of the college-goer's sheer random luck that he applied for this
college out of 16000 others because he had heard its name. <br>
Do not live in the moment, capture it for later. </p>
