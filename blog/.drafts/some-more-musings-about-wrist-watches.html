In one of my previous posts about my watch collection I talked deeply of my love for HMT watches. But not just HMT watches, mechanical 
watches by other makers as well. I talked how I love wearing a mechanical watch. <br>

 <h2>The Lost Family Watch</h2>

It was a late spring evening, I had just finished my dinner, while the others were still eating. Suddenly I had a question for my dad, a 
really important one. Trying to quench my irresitable desire to know the answer I finally asked my dad "Papa, Didn't your Nana Ji also have a 
HMT mechanical watch ?" <br>Unlike the question, the reply didn't come out as smoothly as one might expect it to. Almost immideatly my dad 
started to cough, almost choking on the bit of food he was choking. In a few seconds the coughs stopped and he took a sip of water pausing 
his meal which is something he rarely does. "Now what the hell in world reminded you of that watch" Said my dad. I replied "Aise hi : )" With 
a smug nostalgic grin on his face, he replied "That watch wasn't a HMT".... "It was a Swiss watch from the 50s"<br> "Then what happened to it 
?" I followed. "I asked my Nana Ji to give that watch to me once, he was fine with it. He took it off and then gave it to me"...<i>sigh</i>.. 
"But then he changed his mind and decided to keep it with him for the while, and told my maami ji to give the watch to me after his 
death"...... <br>"Unfortunaltey, Mami Ji, the sole witness to his wish passed away before him, and after Nana ji's death I didnt feel like 
asking my Mamaji for the watch as it seemed inapropriate."<br>

 <h2>That watch may be lost, fret not I have another antiuqe timepiece for you</h2>


 <br><h2>So you're telling me there's another HMT lying about the house in some closet ?</h2>
