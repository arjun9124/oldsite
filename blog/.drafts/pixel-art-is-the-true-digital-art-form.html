In this post, I shall be expressing my newfound appreciation of Pixel art.

Personally, I have always been a fan of old 90's graphics and retro computing in general. Old 90's graphics, although a compromise made by the artists for the days low graphics memory have in this age become something people appreciate. 

Afterall, it still is an art. And what an art ! Trying to express as much as one can with as less they have is truly a skill. To me this digital art form is the best form of digital art, something that at it's core originated on the computer. No fancy brushes that mimic real life brushes and pens, no artificial realism. It's just pixels !

It's something that can only be properly made with the digital, and can only be properly viewed on it.

Now there are plenty of very good artists who work with digital art, but one thing their art lacks is the true essence of digital. Their art may be hyper realistic, it may be a very humanly art they still do not get as near as pixel art because of one reason, its soul. 


It's art that immediately differentiates itself from other humanly art, neither replicating real life nor looking like something an artist might as well could have made by hand, it gives me a strange blissful yet haunting feeling. Blissful from the marvelous depictions of the world around us, haunting from it's very nature. Its very nature of making one wonder whether they are stuck in the digital. It does not pixel by pixel replicate our world, but mimics it in a way which makes us realize the difference between what lies inside the screen and what lies outside it. 

It's weirdly euphoric in a way too if one might put themselves into the seat of the observer and just watch the pixel world from their eye.

From depictions of urban cityscapes to quiet forests and anything in the middle, pixel art has a diverse range of styles and depictions. And when one thinks this art is a bit lifeless, you have animated pixel art too ! Some of my favorite pixel arts. In no particular order.
