# You will want to change these variables to your needs.
# In order to cleanly use sed on a multi-line file, we have to use `tr` to
# convert newlines to a set character, then run sed, then reconvert the
# character. Unfortunately, due to a current issue in GNU's tr, characters of
# more than one byte are not functioning properly. It would be more ideal to
# use a rarer character (some random Tamil character, for example), but ^ is
# one byte.
replchar='^'
# So if you have a page with ^ in it, you'll have to change this to another
# single byte character that isn't in the page like ~ or something.

# Eh, I'm a brainlet and I'm not sure how to elegantly add in the content to
# the RSS feed without first writing it out to a file. This is because if we
# tried run, say, a sed substitute command, we'd have to escape with \
# basically every other character. If you know how to do it without creating a
# temporary file, tell me. I do the same in lb, actually.

# yes luke is surely a brainlet but good script.
